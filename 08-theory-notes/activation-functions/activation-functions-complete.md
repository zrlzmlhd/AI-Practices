## What Are Activation Functions?

### Definition

An **activation function** is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron that introduces non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns.

**Mathematical Form**:
```
output = activation(weighted_sum + bias)
output = f(Σ(w_i × x_i) + b)
```

### Key Properties

1. **Non-linearity**: Enables learning of complex, non-linear relationships
2. **Differentiability**: Required for backpropagation (gradient-based learning)
3. **Range**: Output bounds affect network stability
4. **Monotonicity**: Whether function always increases/decreases
5. **Zero-centered**: Whether output is centered around zero

---

## Why Do We Need Them?

### The Problem with Linear Functions

Without activation functions (or with only linear activations), a neural network is equivalent to a single-layer linear model, regardless of depth:

```
Layer 1: y₁ = W₁x + b₁
Layer 2: y₂ = W₂y₁ + b₂ = W₂(W₁x + b₁) + b₂ = (W₂W₁)x + (W₂b₁ + b₂)
```

This collapses to: `y = Wx + b` (a single linear transformation)

### What Non-linearity Provides

1. **Universal Approximation**: Can approximate any continuous function
2. **Feature Hierarchy**: Learn increasingly abstract representations
3. **Decision Boundaries**: Create complex, non-linear decision boundaries
4. **Expressiveness**: Model real-world phenomena (which are rarely linear)

---

## Classic Activation Functions

### 1. Sigmoid

**Formula**:
```
σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
```

**Derivative**:
```
σ'(x) = σ(x) × (1 - σ(x))
```

**Properties**:
- **Range**: (0, 1)
- **Zero-centered**: No
- **Monotonic**: Yes (strictly increasing)
- **Differentiable**: Yes (everywhere)

**When to Use**:
-  Binary classification output layer (probability interpretation)
-  Gate mechanisms (LSTM, GRU)
-  Hidden layers (causes vanishing gradient)

**Advantages**:
- Smooth, continuous output
- Clear probabilistic interpretation
- Bounded output prevents explosion

**Disadvantages**:
- **Vanishing gradient**: Saturates at extremes (gradient → 0)
- **Not zero-centered**: Causes zig-zagging in gradient descent
- **Computationally expensive**: Exponential operation

**Historical Note**: Dominant in early neural networks (1980s-2000s), now largely replaced by ReLU in hidden layers.

---

### 2. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)

**Formula**:
```
tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))
       = 2σ(2x) - 1
```

**Derivative**:
```
tanh'(x) = 1 - tanh²(x)
```

**Properties**:
- **Range**: (-1, 1)
- **Zero-centered**: Yes
- **Monotonic**: Yes
- **Differentiable**: Yes

**When to Use**:
-  RNN/LSTM hidden states
-  Output layer for regression in [-1, 1]
-  Hidden layers (better than sigmoid, but still vanishing gradient)

**Advantages**:
- Zero-centered (better than sigmoid)
- Stronger gradients than sigmoid
- Symmetric around origin

**Disadvantages**:

---

### 3. Softmax

```

**Properties**:
- **Range**: (0, 1) with Σ outputs = 1
- **Output**: Probability distribution
- **Differentiable**: Yes

**When to Use**:
-  Multi-class classification output layer (REQUIRED)
-  Never in hidden layers

**Advantages**:
- Converts logits to probabilities
- Differentiable
- Interpretable as confidence scores

**Disadvantages**:
- Numerically unstable without proper implementation
- Sensitive to outliers
- Computationally expensive for large number of classes

**Implementation Tip**:
```python
# Numerically stable softmax
def softmax_stable(x):
    exp_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))  # Subtract max for stability
    return exp_x / np.sum(exp_x)
```

---

## ReLU Family

### 1. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)

-  When training speed is critical
-  Deep networks (doesn't saturate for positive values)

**Advantages**:
- **Computationally efficient**: Simple max operation
- **No vanishing gradient** for positive inputs
- **Sparse activation**: ~50% neurons are zero
- **Biological plausibility**: Similar to neuron firing

**Disadvantages**:

- **Not zero-centered**: Can slow convergence
- **Unbounded**: Can lead to exploding activations

**The Dying ReLU Problem**:
- Occurs when large negative bias pushes neuron into negative region
- Gradient is always 0, so weights never update
- Can affect 10-40% of neurons in practice
- Solutions: Leaky ReLU, He initialization, lower learning rates

---

### 2. Leaky ReLU

**Formula**:
```
LeakyReLU(x) = x if x > 0 else αx

---

### 6. GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)

**Formula** (exact):
```
GELU(x) = x × Φ(x) = x × (1/2)[1 + erf(x/√2)]
```

**Approximation** (commonly used):
```
GELU(x) ≈ 0.5x(1 + tanh[√(2/π)(x + 0.044715x³)])

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Initialization Matters

Different activations require different initialization strategies:

**ReLU Family**:
```python
# He initialization (Kaiming)
nn.init.kaiming_normal_(layer.weight, mode='fan_in', nonlinearity='relu')
```

**Tanh/Sigmoid**:
```python
# Xavier/Glorot initialization
nn.init.xavier_normal_(layer.weight)
```

**SELU**:
```python
# LeCun initialization
nn.init.normal_(layer.weight, mean=0, std=1/sqrt(fan_in))
```

---

### 2. Batch Normalization Interaction

**Compatible**:
- ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Swish, GELU
- Use BatchNorm → Activation order

**Incompatible**:
- SELU (designed to work without normalization)
- EvoNorm (combines normalization and activation)

**Best Practice**:
```python
# Standard pattern
nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size)
nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
nn.ReLU()  # or other activation
```

---

### 3. Gradient Clipping

For activations prone to exploding gradients (ReLU, Linear):

```python
# PyTorch
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)

# TensorFlow
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0)
```

---

### 4. Learning Rate Adjustment

Different activations may require different learning rates:

- **ReLU**: Standard learning rates (1e-3 to 1e-4)
- **GELU/Swish**: Slightly lower (5e-4 to 1e-4)
- **SELU**: Specific learning rate schedules
- **Sigmoid/Tanh**: Lower learning rates (1e-4 to 1e-5)

---

### 5. Debugging Dead Neurons

**Check activation statistics**:
```python
def check_dead_neurons(activations):
    """Check percentage of dead neurons (always zero)"""
    dead = (activations == 0).all(dim=0).float().mean()
    print(f"Dead neurons: {dead.item()*100:.2f}%")

# During training
activations = model.get_activations(x)
check_dead_neurons(activations)
```

**Solutions**:
- Lower learning rate
- Use Leaky ReLU or ELU
- Better initialization
- Reduce batch size

---

### 6. Mixed Activation Strategies

You can use different activations in different parts of the network:

```python
class HybridNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, 3)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()  # Fast for early layers

        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 3)
        self.swish = nn.SiLU()  # Better for deeper layers

        self.fc = nn.Linear(128, 10)
        # No activation (logits for softmax)
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

###  Don't Do This

1. **Using Sigmoid/Tanh in deep hidden layers**
   - Causes severe vanishing gradient
   - Use ReLU or modern alternatives

2. **Forgetting activation in output layer**
   ```python
   # Wrong for classification
   output = nn.Linear(hidden, num_classes)(x)

   # Correct
   logits = nn.Linear(hidden, num_classes)(x)
   output = nn.Softmax(dim=-1)(logits)
   ```

3. **Using ReLU after final layer for regression**
   - Limits output to positive values
   - Use Linear (no activation) for unbounded regression

4. **Mixing SELU with BatchNorm**
   - SELU is self-normalizing, conflicts with BatchNorm
   - Use one or the other, not both

5. **Using wrong initialization with activation**
   - ReLU with Xavier init → suboptimal
   - Use He init for ReLU, Xavier for Tanh

---

## Performance Comparison

### Computational Cost (Relative to ReLU = 1.0)

| Swish | 2.8× | Low |
| Mish | 4.5× | Low |
| Hard Swish | 1.3× | Low |
| SwiGLU | 3.5× | High (2× params) |

### Accuracy (Typical Improvement over ReLU)

| Task | GELU | Swish | Mish | SwiGLU |
|------|------|-------|------|--------|
| Image Classification | +0.5% | +0.3% | +0.7% | N/A |
| Language Modeling | +1.2% | +0.8% | +0.5% | +1.5% |
| Object Detection | +0.4% | +0.6% | +0.9% | N/A |

*Note: Improvements vary by architecture and dataset*
